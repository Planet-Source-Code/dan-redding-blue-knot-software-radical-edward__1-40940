### Description

Could be used to pester someone... ;-)

Inspired by the free-wheeling Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky 4th; this started out as someone else's project about making various shaped regions... but then it got extremely silly.

A little happy face appears on the screen. When the mouse moves over it it giggles and skitters away, occasionally making a clone of itself.

Project does have some redeeming qualities, like demonstrating how to load gifs and play wave files from a resourse file; and of course the original region code.

Oh, and just hold down the shift key and move over a face to quit the program.

Yay, Edward!
